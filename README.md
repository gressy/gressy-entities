Gressy-Entities
===============

Part of the Gressy Project.

This module provides a few goodies required for the auto-panel functionality:
- Base Entity class that all other entities should subclass
- Base User class, needed for the panel auth
- Panel Controller which provides basic CRUD for all entity types
- User Controller for panel login/logout
- Some misc helpers needed internally, which can be useful for your API too
